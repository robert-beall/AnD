# Linked List

A set of non-contiguous nodes connected via references. Each node in the linked list points to the next node in the list with a reference. 

## Storage

Elements in a linked list are *not* stored contiguously in memory. No specific order in memory is given for elements in a linked list. Instead, elements are connected via references from one node to the next. 

## Benefits 
Linked lists allow for easy insertion and deletion of elements from the list during iteration. 
## Drawbacks
Data in a linked list must be accessed linearly.
