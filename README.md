# AnD
This is a repository for me to review and explore algorithms and datastructures in different languages.
- [AnD](#and)
  - [Structure](#structure)

The primary languages used will be [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but I will likely expand to using other languages as well. The purpose of using these two languages primarily is to build proficiency in them. However, JavaScript/Typescript, Python, C/C++, Java, and others may be used as well.
## Structure
The basic directory structure will follow this model: 
- Root/
  - Algorithms/
    - Binary-Search/
      - notes.md
      - Rust/
      - Go/
      - ...
  - Datastructures/
    - Linked-List/
      - notes.md
      - Rust/
      - Go/
      - ...

Under each of the two main directories will be subdirectories per algorithm/datastructure. The first file will be a notes file outlining the algorithm/datastructure. The subsequent directories will each represent a solution implemented in a specific language (Rust, Go, Java, etc.).
